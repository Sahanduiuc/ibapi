  Using the TWS API, you can request real time market data for trading and analysis. It is important to mention that our real time market data is not tick-by-tick meaning you will not obtain
  every single price movement happening in the market. Instead, real time data is given as snapshots generated at a fixed given pace:
  
	<table>
		<tr><th>Product</th><th>Frequency</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Stocks, Futures and others</td><td>250 ms</td></tr>
		<tr><td>US Options</td><td>100 ms</td></tr>
		<tr><td>FX pairs</td><td>5 ms</td></tr>
	</table>
