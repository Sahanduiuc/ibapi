/*! \page error_handling Error Handling

	Whenever the client application performs a request to the TWS which requires a response from it (i.e. placing an order, requesting market data, subscribing to account updates, etc.),
	the TWS will produce the desired result <b>as long as the request was made appropriately</b>. When the TWS is unable to process the request properly, with only rare exceptions it will return an error message pointing in the mistake's direction. 
	
	-<b>Exception</b>: if a market data request is made during a competing session (when a paper user is logged into simultaneously on a different computer from the associated live user) there is not currently a message returned from TWS. Also, if a request is made prior to full establishment of connection (denoted by a returned 2104 or 2106 error code <i>"Data Server is Ok"</i>), there may not be a response from the request. 
	
	Error messages sent by the TWS are handled by the @ref IBApi::EWrapper::error method. The @ref IBApi::EWrapper::error event contains the originating request Id (or the orderId in case the 
	error was raised when placing an order), a numeric error code and a brief description of it. It is important to keep in mind that this function is used for <i>true</i> error messages as well as notifications that do not necessarily mean anything is wrong.
