	The TWS API is an interface to IB's standalone trading applications, TWS and IB Gateway. These are both standalone, Java-based trading applications which were designed to require the use of a graphical user interface for the security of user authentication. For that reason, "headless" operation is not supported.  

	\section tws The Trader Workstation
	
	Our market maker-designed IB Trader Workstation (TWS) lets traders, investors, and institutions trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds and funds on over 100 markets worldwide from a single account. The TWS API is a programming interface to TWS and as such, it forcefully requires a TWS to connect to. To use version 9.72+ of the API, it is necessary to have TWS version 952 or higher. 

	\section gateway The IB Gateway
	
	As an alternative to TWS for API users, IB also offers IB Gateway (IBG). From the perspective of an API application, IB Gateway and TWS are essentially identical; both represent a server to which an API client application can open a
	socket connection once the user has first authenticated a session. In either case (TWS or IBG), the user must authenticate a session by manually entering credentials into the login window- for security reasons, a headless session of TWS or IBG without a GUI is not supported. From the user's perspective, IB Gateway is a lighter application which consumes about 40% fewer resources and has some advantages over using an API connection to TWS- most noticeably, it does not have the designed limitation that an autologoff time is programmed when it must shutdown to be restarted. 
	
	-<i>There are however some times in which it will also be necessary to restart IB Gateway</i>, for instance if there is a change to IB's contract database because of a ticker symbol changed or the introduction of a new contract, it will be necessary to restart IBG to access the updated contract information.

	The advantages of TWS over IBG is that it provides the end user with many tools (Risk Navigator, OptionTrader, BookTrader, etc) and a graphical user interface which can be used to monitor an account or place orders. For beginning API users, it is recommended to first become acquainted with TWS before using IBG. 
	
	<b>For simplicity, this guide will mostly refer to the TWS although the reader should understand that for the TWS API's purposes, TWS and IB Gateway are synonymous.</b>
	
	\section enable_api Enable API connections
		
	Before any client application can connect to the Trader Workstation, the TWS needs to be configured to listen for incoming API connections on a very specific port. By default when TWS is first installed it will not allow API connections. IBG by contrast accepts socket-based API connections by default. To enable API access in TWS, navigate to
	the TWS' API settings at Edit -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings and make sure the "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" option is activated as shown below:

	Also important to mention is the "Socket port". By default a production account TWS session will be set for socket port 7496, and a paper account session will listen on socket port 7497. However these are just default values chosen because they are almost always available on any computer. They can be changed to any open socket port, as long as the socket ports specified in the API client and TWS settings match. If there are multiple TWS sessions on one computer, the socket port is used to distinguish the TWS session. Since 
	only one application can listen on one port at a time you will need to assign different ports to each running TWS.
	
	<b>Important: when running paper and live TWS on the same computer, make sure your client application is connecting to the right TWS!</b>
		
	\section read_only Read Only API

	The API Settings dialogue allows you to configure TWS to note accept API orders with the "Read Only" setting. By default, "Read Only" is enabled as an additional precautionary measure. Information about orders is not available to the API when read-only mode is enabled. 
		
	\section master_client Master Client ID

	By default the "Master Client ID" field is unset. To specify that a certain client should <i>automatically</i> receive updates about all open orders, as well as commission reports from orders placed from all clients, the client's ID should be set as the Master Client ID in TWS or IBG Global Configuration. The clientID is specified from an API client application in the initial function call to IBApi::EClientSocket::eConnect.

	\section install Installing the API source
	
	The API itself can be downloaded and installed from:
	
	http://interactivebrokers.github.io/
	
	Many third party applications already have their own version of the API which is installed in the process of installing the third party application. If using a third party product, it should first be verified if the API must be separately installed and what version of the API is needed- many third party products are only compatible with a specific API version. 
	
	The Windows version of the API installer will create a directory "C:\TWS API\" for the API source code in addition to automatically copying two files into the Windows directory for the ActiveX/DDE and C++ APIs. <b><i>It is important that the API installs to the <b>C</b>: drive</i></b>, as otherwise API applications may not be able to find the associated files. 
	
	\section changing Changing the installed API version
	
	(On Windows Only)

	If a different version of the ActiveX (v9.71 or lower) or C++ API is required than the one currently installed on the system, there are additional steps required to uninstall the previous API version to manually remove a file called "TwsSocketClient.dll":
	
	1) Uninstall the API from the "Add/Remove Tool" in the Windows Control Panel as usual
	
	2) Delete the C:\TWS API\ folder if any files are still remaining to prevent a version mismatch. 
	
	3) Locate the file "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\TwsSocketClient.dll". Delete this file.
	
	4) Restart the computer before installing a different API version.
