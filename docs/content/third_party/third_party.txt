/*! \page third_party Third Party Software

	Third party software vendors make use of the TWS' programming interface (API) to integrate their platforms with Interactive Broker's. Thanks to the TWS API, well known platforms
	such as Ninja Trader or Multicharts can interact with the TWS to fetch market data, place orders and/or manage account and portfolio information.

	- <b>It is important to keep in mind that most third party API platforms are not compatible with all IB account structures</b>. Always check first with the software vendor before opening a specific account type or converting an IB account type. For instance, many third party API platforms such as NinjaTrader and TradeNavigator are <b>not</b> compatible with IB linked account structures, so it is highly recommended to first check with the third party vendor before linking your IB accounts. 
	
	A non-exhaustive list of third party platforms implementing our interface can be found in our 
	<a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet" target="_blank" class="linkexternal">Investor's Marketplace</a>. As stated in the
	marketplace, the vendors' list is in no way a recommendation from Interactive Brokers. If you are interested in a given platform that is not listed, please contact the platform's
	vendor directly for further information.

	\section  third_party_faq Frequently Asked Questions

	Below is a list of frequently asked questions. All answers are given considering a standard usage of the TWS. Note that some vendors might provide an additional customisation level
	to simplify things. If the below description does not reflect the way you operate your third party software with the TWS, please contact your vendor directly.

	\subsection tp_faq_connect How to connect a 3rd party platform to Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation
	
	Connecting any third party program to the TWS requires you to enable API connectivity on the TWS itself as explained in @ref enable_api section. Your third party program will need
	to provide means for you to specify at least a <b>host</b> and a <b>port</b>. In the vast majority of cases the third party program will be running on the exact same computer as the TWS
	therefore the host IP can be specified as <b>127.0.0.1</b> whereas the port needs to be the exact same as the one configured in the TWS' API Settings, typically <b>7496</b> or <b>7497</b>. 
	Below is an illustration showing one of our API sample applications highlighting the typical connectivity fields a program connecting to the TWS should provide. Note there is an additional 
	field for "clientId". You can set this id to any positive integer including zero or to whatever your third party application's provider recommends. 
	
	<b>Note:</b> for vendor-specific instructions please contact your third party provider directly.

	\subsection tp_support Where to get support for a third party software connecting to the TWS.
	
	Interactive Brokers cannot provide any kind of support or advice for software not developed by IB itself. Depending on the nature of your inquiry, our support staff's advice might
	be quite limited since in most of cases it is not realistic to reverse-engineer a third party program in order to understand how is it using our API. Because of this, the third
	party vendor's support team should always be the first contact option. 
	
	\subsection tp_ping_pong My program's vendor did not find any issue on its side and asked me to contact Interactive Brokers directly.
	
	There will be occasions when a given operation will not be fulfilled as expected not because of a malfunction in either platform but because of the business logic involved. The 
	typical behaviour of the TWS is to either perform the requested operation or to return an explanatory message which will point you in the right direction. It is the duty of the third 
	party program to clearly show these TWS' messages within its own user interface. Without a relevant error message our support team will not be able to give any advice. 
	
	In case of a malfunction on Interactive Broker's side, clear and concise technical information needs to be provided including evidence of the malfunction in the form of TWS or API message log 
	files as detailed in @ref tws_logs section of this guide. Collecting all the needed information is not a trivial process and might require a very detailed knowledge of our API. To
	prevent being caught in between support teams, please request your third party vendor to contact us directly via email to api@interactivebrokers.com with as much information as possible.
	
	\subsection tp_bypass_warning TWS generates warning messages that block my orders being automatically transmitted
	
	There are precautionary settings in TWS that are designed to be a order safety check. TWS would usually generate a pop-up warning dialogue, or sent back an error message via the API, when there is any violation to the pre-define precautionary settings in <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/tws/usersguidebook/configuretws/define_precautionary_settings.htm" target="_blank" class="linkexternal">TWS Presets</a>. 
	
	For users who uses a third party software to place orders but also receives data feed from a different vendor other than IB, TWS would also generate a default warning <i>"You are trying to submit an order without having market data for this instrument"</i> on receiving orders from third party. The checked order will not be transmitted automatically unless user click "Transmit" button of the order in TWS. 
	
	TWS precautions can be bypassed by navigating to <i>File/Edit → Global Configuration → API → Precautions</i>, and check the box <i>"Bypass Order Precautions for API Orders"</i>. Once this is done, API orders placed from a third party software will not be checked by TWS precautions.
	
	\subsection tp_data I cannot see any market data in my third party program
	
	As explained in our @ref market_data page, in order to be able to pull market data from the TWS, you need to acquire the @ref market_subscriptions of the product(s) you are interested in.
	
	\subsection tp_data_sharing I do have the Live Data Subscriptions I need but when using my paper trading user name I am still unable to obtain it.
	
	Make sure you are @ref paper_sharing
	
	\subsection tp_pacing_violation I am obtaining a message saying "Historical data request pacing violation"
	
	Please refer to our @ref historical_limitations page
	
	\subsection tp_no_eod My third party program shows "No data of type EODChart is available" when trying to load a chart
	
	This message is returned when the requested End of Day (EOD) market data is not available in our systems. You can easily verify this by loading the exact same chart using the TWS to obtain the same result:
	
	\image html no_eod_data.png
	
	Please contact our General Support team's Market Data department for further information.
	
	\subsection tp_no_data I am obtaining a "HMDS query returned no data" message.
	
	Sometimes the data prior to the specified requested date is also not available for several reasons. Suppose a product started quoting (generating data) on 1st January 2016 but your third party
	program requests data prior to this date. To prevent this error message adjust your third party program's charting parameters accordingly.
	
	\subsection tp_cfd_charting I cannot chart CFDs from my third party program yet the TWS shows the data correctly.
	
	Except for <b>Index CFDs</b>, CFDs do not have any market data of their own. What the TWS displays is the CFD's <b>underlying contract's</b> data. Whenever you try to fetch non-Index CFD data 
	from the TWS, you will obtain an error message asking you to pull it's underlying contract's data instead. Some third party programs' user interface only allow placing orders via their charts.
	Given that no data can be loaded for these products and the impossibility of the third party program to apply a similar conversion as the TWS, you might find your third party software not able 
	to place orders as a consequence!
	
	\subsection tp_paper_trading How can I connect my third party program to my paper trading account?

	Connections via the TWS API are not aware of the user name with which you are logged in with in your TWS. From this point of view the API makes no difference between live or paper trading. 
	Since third party programs only connect any running TWS on the specified host and port it only takes you to launch the TWS and log into it with your paper trading credentials, make 
	sure you @ref enable_api and connect to it from your third party application using the same procedure.
	
	\subsection tp_paper_with_live Can I connect simultaneously to my live and paper TWS?
	
	From our side, yes. You can launch as many instances of the TWS as you need using different user name/password combinations. It is crucial though to make sure each TWS is listening on 
	a different <b>port</b> as described in the @ref enable_api section. Note that your might as well need to launch multiple instances of your third party program and/or have a way
	of telling when is your program using the paper or the live accounts.
	
	\subsection tp_data_mismatch The charts shown by my charting software differ from the ones shown by the TWS
	
	Given that the historical data sent down the TWS API comes from the same source as the one displayed by the TWS itself it is almost impossible for it to differ.
	
	Some charting platforms circumvent our @ref historical_limitations by combining real time and historical data. Since our real time market data is <b>not</b> tick-by-tick, bars built from it
	will hardly match those retrieved from our historical market data service.

	Alternatively, you might as well be comparing different charts without noticing. A chart displaying data from NYSE will never be the same as another built from the ARCA exchange
	or from our SMART routing strategy. inadvertently you might as well be looking at TRADES on one side while having MIDPOINT or BID_ASK on another. Another common mistake involves having
	different timezones between the TWS and your client application.
	
	\subsection fees Is there a fee involved to receive data from the API?
	
	Streaming real time data or receiving historical bars from the API requires streaming level 1 market data subscriptions. Subscriptions for instruments other than forex, bonds, and index CFDs incur a monthly fee.  
	http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/market_data.html
	
	\subsection trial_accounts Can the TWS API be used with trial accounts?
	
	Yes it is possible to connect an API application to a trial account. However it is not possible to receive real time market data or historical candlesticks for most instruments from the TWS API with a trial account login.
	
	\subsection apis_available What types of APIs are available? 
	
	There is an API for Traders Workstation (TWS API). It is the most full-featured and can be used by all clients with trading access.
	There is a WT Web API for white-branded advisors and introducing brokers that provides streaming and historical data.
	There is a REST WebAPI for third party companies and institutions. It can be used to place stock and forex orders, receive market data snapshots, and receive account and portfolio information.
	https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1325
	
	\subsection api_vs_fix What are differences between connecting to the TWS API and using a FIX/CTCI connection?
	
	The TWS API is an interface to TWS or IB Gateway. It provides many functionalities, such as the ability to receive market data, place orders, and receive account information. The TWS API requires that the user first login to either TWS or IB Gateway, both standalone desktop applications. The TWS API has an order rate limitation of 50 orders per second.
	
	FIX/CTCI connectivity can be configured to connect either with IB Gateway or directly to IB. Unlike the TWS API, FIX/CTCI is only for order placement and can not be used to receive market data. Also, FIX/CTCI has monthly minimum commissions involved. 
	
	\subsection multiple_trading_applications Can I use another trading application (IBKR mobile, WebTrader, TWS) while an API program is connected?
 
	To connect to the same IB account simultaneously with multiple trading applications it is necessary to have multiple usernames. Additional usernames can be created through Account Management free of charge. Market data subscriptions however only apply to individual usernames so the fees would be charged separately. 
	
	\subsection eligible_accounts Can the TWS API be used with any IB account? 
	
	Most third party API applications do not support all IB account structures, so it is highly recommended to consult with the third party software vendor before opening or converting to a specific IB account type to use with a third party application. 
	
	\subsection untransmitted_orders Why does an order from the API appear as untransmitted in TWS with a 'T' button next to it? 
 
	If an order appears in TWS as untransmitted and is not sent to IB, there are generally three causes: 
	(1) There is an error in the order preventing transmission
	(2) There is a TWS precautionary setting preventing transmission to IB. Precautionary settings can be globally overridden in TWS through the settings in Global Configuration at API -> Precautions -> Bypass Order Precautions for API Orders
	(3) The order was sent with the 'transmit' boolean flag in the API Order class set to False. By default, its value is True. 
	
	\subsection autolaunching Is autolaunching of TWS or IB Gateway supported by IB? 
	
	Unfortunately for security reasons auto-launching of TWS or IB Gateway is not supported. Both applications are designed to require the user to manually enter his or her credentials into the UI. 
 
	\subsection autoshutdown_requirement Is it possible to disable the daily auto-logoff requirement of TWS? 
	
	It is possible to adjust the time of auto-logoff, but not disable it. However, IB Gateway can be substituted for TWS for use with an API application and it does not have the daily logoff requirement. 
 
	\subsection programming_consultants Do you recommend any third party products or programming consultants? 
	IB does not recommend particular third parties, but a list is maintained on the Investors Marketplace. 
	https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet
 
	\subsection tws_vs_ibg What are the differences between using an API application with TWS and IB Gateway? 
	
	From the point of view of an API application, TWS and IB Gateway are essentially identical. TWS additionally offers the user the ability to directly view positions, trades, and market data, and provides a number of tools for trading, research, and analysis. IB Gateway has a simple graphical user interface that is only used for modifying settings. The advantages of IB Gateway is that it consumes 40% fewer resources and can run for longer periods without automatically closing down. http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html
 
	\subsection gui_requirement Is it possible to run TWS or IB Gateway on a headless server? 
 
	Both TWS and IB Gateway are designed to have a user interface for the client to enter their account credentials. For that reason, headless or GUI-less operation is not supported. 
 
	\subsection upgrading Do I ever need to upgrade the TWS API? 
 
	TWS is very backwards compatible with the API so it is not necessary to upgrade the API when upgrading to a new version of TWS. Generally the only reason it is necessary to upgrade the API is to take advantage of a new feature introduced in a more recent API version.
 
	\subsection red_data_indicator The data indicator in IB Gateway is red. Is something wrong?
 
	It is normal for the market data farm connection indicator to stay red until a market data request is made from the API application. The farms can also turn red after extended inactivity. 
 
	\subsection reporting_problem How do I report a problem to the API Support team? 
	
	Diagnosing specific issues will generally require that API logging is enabled in TWS or IB Gateway when the issue occurs. 
	In TWS this is done by navigating to Global Configuration -> API -> Settings and checking the box "Create API Message Log", and setting the logging level to "Detail"
	In IB Gateway, these settings are found at Configure -> Settings -> API -> Settings
	If an issue occurs after logs are enabled, they can be uploaded using the combination Ctrl-Alt-Q and then clicking Submit. Please let API Support know logs have been uploaded.
 
	\subsection historical_positions Are historical account positions or account values available from the TWS API? 
 
	Since the API cannot provide information not available in TWS, historical portfolio information is not available. It is available from statements and flex queries in Account Management.
 
	\subsection web_hosting Does IB provide hosting services for custom algorithms?
 
	Unfortunately no, web hosting is not provided.
 
	\subsection excel_windows Is there an Excel API for MacOS? 
	
	The Excel APIs require a Windows computer with Microsoft Excel.
