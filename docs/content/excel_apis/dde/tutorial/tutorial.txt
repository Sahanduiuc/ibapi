	The TWS API for Windows needs to be downloaded and installed before proceeding. Version 975 or higher is recommended in order to use the DDE Socket Bridge API. You can download this version from http://interactivebrokers.github.io/.  

	The TWS must be up and running while using any API connection including DDE.<br>
	
	- For the DDE Socket Bridge API available in v975, socket connections must be enabled in TWS or IB Gateway. In TWS, this setting is at Global Configuration -> API -> Settings -> "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" (in IB Gateway it is enabled by default).
	
	- Additionally to run the DDE Socket Bridge API, the DDE server must be launched by running the file C:\\TWS API\\samples\\DdeSocketBridge\\runDdeSocketBridge.bat as described at @ref dde_intro
