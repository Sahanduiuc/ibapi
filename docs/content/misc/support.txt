/*! \page support TWS API Support & Troubleshooting

	When experiencing problems with the TWS API, please make sure to go through our documentation and ensure the TWS API is being correctly. As mentioned in this guide's @ref introduction
	Interactive Brokers unfortunately cannot offer any programming assistance nor help troubleshooting its clients' code. Below are some suggestions which will hopefully help you
	troubleshooting your TWS API client application.

	- <b>Make use of the sample applications</b>: the TWS API provides plenty of sample code demonstrating its capabilities. Any issue on the TWS API will surely manifest on the sample applications as well. If a problem cannot be 
	reproducible within our sample applications, chances are the problem lies on your implementation.
	<br><br>
	
	- <b>Refer to the TWS itself</b>: the TWS API is nothing but a communication channel between your client application and the TWS. This implies that if for whatever reason the TWS itself 
	cannot receive or display the information you are trying to request and/or if it is displaying something else than what you expect, the possible issue would lie within the TWS and not on 
	the API. As long as the TWS API is delivering the exact same information as what is shown in the TWS you can rule out any malfunction on it. If you are using the IB Gateway, it is always 
	good idea to try the same with the TWS.
	<br><br>
	
	- <b>Keep your TWS/IB Gateway up to date</b>: at IB we are constantly introducing new features and iterating over the existing ones. Because of this, we strongly recommend our users to keep 
	their TWS as up to date as possible. In the unlikely event of experiencing problems with the TWS and/or the IB Gateway, please update to the latest available version on our website.

	\section tws_logs TWS/IBG Logs
	
	When all the above fail, please contact our Technical Support at the earliest opportunity. In order for us to investigate we will require your Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway (IBG) Detailed Log File showing the anomaly being
	reported. 
	
	\subsection logging_level Logging Level
	
	The Logging Level must be set to 'Detail' for troubleshooting the API. 
	
	<b>Steps to set Logging Level to Detail</b>
	
	TWS:
	- Navigate to File/Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings
	- Set <i>Logging Level</i> to <i>Detail</i>
	
	\image html logging_detail.png
	
	IB Gateway:
	- Navigate to Configure → Settings → API → Settings
	- Set <i>Logging Level</i> to <i>Detail</i>
	
	Click @ref logging_level_details "Here" for more details.
	
	\subsection api_logs API Log Files
	
	In addition to the TWS/IB Gateway log files, it is possible to generate a different type of log file- the API message log files.
	
	<b>Steps to enable creating API log file</b>
	
	TWS:
	- Navigate to File/Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings
	- Check the box <i>Create API message log file</i>
	
	\image html enable_api_log.png
	
	IB Gateway:
	- Navigate to Configure → Settings → API → Settings
	- Check the box <i>Create API message log file</i>
	 
	\subsection log_files Log file locations
	
	The path and filename of the relevant TWS or IBG log file depends on the version of the software. From within the program the version can be found by navigating to Help -> About Trader Workstation (or About IB Gateway). The version number is the number next to the word 'Build'. For information about the location of the log file for a specific software build please click the applicable link below.

	- @ref tws_956 <br><br>
	
	- @ref ibg_956 <br><br>
	
	To find the location of API log file, please click @ref api_log "Here".
	
	\subsection uploading_logs How to Upload Log Files to API Support
	
	- If a log file has been set to the correct Logging Level (for TWS/IBG logs) and captures the problematic issue, it may be requested by the API Support group. If the log is 2MB or smaller it is best to attach to a ticket in the Message Center. Larger files of up to 15 MB can be emailed as an attachment. And if the file is larger than 15 MB it will have to be compressed as a zip file before being emailed in order to be accepted by the server.
