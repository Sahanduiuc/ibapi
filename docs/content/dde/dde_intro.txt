/*! \page dde_intro Dynamic Data Exchange

	The Dynamic Data Exchange protocol is a method of inter-process communication developed by Microsoft. Thanks to it, it is possible for the TWS to communicate with other applications such as 
	MS Excel.
 
	Interactive Brokers does not offer any programming assistance and therefore it is strongly advised to anyone willing to use any of the TWS DDE API to get familiar with 
	the technologies involved such as the DDE protocol and VBA.

	<b>Important:</b> you will require the 32-bit version of the TWS.
