/*! \page dde_intro Dynamic Data Exchange

	The Dynamic Data Exchange protocol is a method of inter-process communication developed by Microsoft. Thanks to it, it is possible for the TWS to communicate with other applications such as 
	MS Excel.
 
	Interactive Brokers does not offer any programming assistance and therefore it is strongly advised to anyone willing to use any of the TWS DDE API to become familiar with 
	the technologies involved such as the DDE protocol and VBA.

	<b>Important:</b> The 32-bit version of TWS or IB Gateway is required to use the DDE API. 
	
	Note that other programs running on the same computer which use DDE can interfere with the communication between Excel and TWS and cause Excel to 'hang' or 'freeze' after making the initial request. 
	The only solution to this problem is to close other programs using DDE one-by-one to find the culprit. Programs which are known to cause this issue include Google Chrome, Microsoft OneNote, Skype 
	and Adobe Creative Cloud.
