/*! \page dde_realtime_tutorial Real Time Data Tutorial with Excel

	One of the most common inquiries we receive at Interactive Brokers is about export data from the TWS into Excel. Since the TWS does not have functionality to export intra-day, 
	customers are often directed at the TWS API and its Excel sheets in particular. Customers, however, need to be aware of the fact that the distributed 
	sheets are not tools to be used on a daily basis. All our sample applications are merely a demonstration of the API capabilities aimed at experienced programmers who will in turn use 
	them as a reference to develop more complex and robust systems.

	It is possible to view live quotes for multiple products updating real time within Excel. Requests via the TWS DDE API are nothing but Excel formulas (DDE data links) 
	each of them serving a very specific purpose. Market Data retrieval requires at least two different DDE links: one to start the market data subscription and another one which will 
	be receiving the specific tick type.

	This document is a brief tutorial explaining the process behind market data retrieval through MS Excel via the TWS DDE API. All the VBA code is kept to a 
	minimum and its purpose is merely illustrative.
	
	\section dde_rt_requisites Requisites
	
	This tutorial has been developed using Excel 2010 around the 9.72 version of the TWS API components. This version needs to be downloaded and installed before proceeding. You can 
	download this version from http://interactivebrokers.github.io/.  

	The TWS must be up and running while using the DDE connection to TWS. DDE client connectivity must also be enabled via Edit -> Global Configuration -> API -> Settings: Enable DDE clients 
	as indicated in the picture below:

	\section dde_rt_prepare Preparing the request
	
	The formula to start the request will need to provide the TWS with enough information so that the TWS can unambiguously identify which instrument we are interested in. As a first example, 
	we will request FX market data (EUR.USD). The resulting formula will therefore be:
	
	=Ssample123|tik!'id1?req?EUR_CASH_IDEALPRO_USD_~/'
	
	Note that sample123 will have to be replaced with the exact same username entered when logging into the TWS. This applies for all subsequent DDE links shown in this guide.

	If the above formula is copied into any cell of a spreadsheet, the cell should automatically display 0 on it.

	After we have done this, the TWS will be aware that a DDE link is requesting EUR.USD data.
	
	\section dde_rt_receive Receiving the data
	
	Once the TWS recognizes our DDE link trying to pull EUR.USD data, we can proceed to read it. We are currently interested in knowing the bid price of the EUR.USD FX pair, therefore we 
	need to make use of:

	=Ssample123|tik!id1?bid

	Pasting the above formula into the same sheet will have a more exciting result:

	The value displayed on cell D2 is the exact same value the TWS displays for the EUR.USD bid price (at the moment of writing this document) and will keep updating as long as the request is active.
	
	\section dde_rt_understanding Understanding the Formulas
	
	As it was already mentioned, the first formula will ask the TWS to open a DDE channel through which we can obtain EUR.USD data while the second one is merely pulling the bid price for it. To 
	understand the formulas' syntax refer to the @ref dde_rt section from the @ref dde_reference page.
