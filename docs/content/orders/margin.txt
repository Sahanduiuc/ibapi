/*! \page margin Checking Margin Changes
	
	From the API it is possible to check how a specified trade execution is expected to change the account margin requirements for an account in real time. This is done by creating an Order object which has the @ref IBApi::Order::WhatIf flag set to true. By default the whatif boolean in Order has a false value, but if set to True in an Order object with is passed to @ref IBApi::EClient::placeOrder, instead of sending the order to a destination the IB server it will undergo a credit check for the expected post-trade margin requirement. The estimated post-trade margin requirement is returned to the  @ref IBApi::OrderState object.
	
	This is equivalent to creating a order ticket in TWS, clicking "Preview", and viewing the information in the "Margin Impact" panel.
